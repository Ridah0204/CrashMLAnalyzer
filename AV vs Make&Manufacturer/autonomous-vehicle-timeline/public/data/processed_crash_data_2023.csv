The vehicle’s ADS determined that a truck traveling in the adjacent lane had a trajectory towards the Drive Pilot’s lane, and so the Mercedes-Benz test vehicle autonomously applied the brakes to avoid a collision.  After applying the brakes and bringing itself to a standstill, the Mercedes-Benz was then struck in the rear bumper by a trailing semi-truck that did not stop in time.  No injuries were reported, no airbags deployed in either vehicle, and both vehicles were able to be driven from the scene of the incident.
