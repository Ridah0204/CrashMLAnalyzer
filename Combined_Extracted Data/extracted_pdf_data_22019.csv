The Honda -CRV's driver airbag was deployed and the front bumper of the car was partially hanging out of the car's body frame. Drivers from both parties exchanged information and took pictures of the damage. The passenger of the autonomous test vehicle contacted 911 approximately at 10:05 AM and requested a CHP officer on scene. The CHP officer arrived approximately 45 minutes after the initial call and took down a report. After both parties had exchanged information, the officer dismissed both parties.
