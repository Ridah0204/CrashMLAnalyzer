At this point, our driver held the horn down and applied the brakes.  Our driver was unable to avoid the other vehicle due to the limited amount of space between our vehicle and the other vehicle, and the side curb to the left. At this time the car was struck; collision was unavoidable. During this time, our driver was approached by the occupants of the vehicle and information was exchanged. They said they were going to back up into the parking lot as security said they couldn't stop there. Our driver attempted to back up but due to a grinding noise, stopped. At this point our driver went to continue to get information but the occupants walked off and he couldn't abandon the vehicle.
